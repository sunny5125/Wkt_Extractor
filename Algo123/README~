Execute the following command in the shell to compile and run the package:

LINUX:

./1click.sh


##Input file should be stored in the muletrajectory/Input directory as input.txt

##KruskalAlgorithm takes input.txt as input and generates a file mst.txt.

##Graph.java reads the minimum spanning tree from mst.txt.

## After the 1click.sh is run, one needs to enter the number of intervals( ie, latency intervals, a multiple of 60) to get the output in the console sorted by the latency..


What does 1click.sh do?

##It simply calls other bash scripts like delete_output.sh, compile.sh, run.sh and copyMuleInfo.sh

#delete_output.sh deletes previous output files and mule info from muletrajectory/Output and muletrajectory/Mules

#compile.sh compiles all the source codes( with .java extension) in muletrajectory/ and Input/

#run.sh runs the KruskalAlgorithm class (to generate mst.txt) and unitTest.
